## Quality Rubric
- [ ] Documented - Contains instructions for a user to set up app locally
- [ ] Functional - Project runs in localhost
- [ ] Structured - Code is well organized into a meaningful file structure
- [ ] Abstracted - Small, single-responsibility functions leveraged for encapsulation & reusability
- [ ] Not Commented - Unless truly necessary. No dead code, console.logs, etc.
- [ ] Interface is user friendly - Has unoffensive and attractive layout / design / style
- [ ] Follow good Git team behaviors (do all your work on branches & submit pull requests for review before merging to master and meaningful commit messages)
- [ ] Variables, functions, css classes, etc. are meaningfully named (no comments exist in code to explain functionality - the names serve that function)
